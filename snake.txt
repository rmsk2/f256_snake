Snake for the F256
==================

In this game a caterpillar wants to eat as many apples as possible which appear
at random locations on the playing field. The problem is that with each apple
the caterpillar eats the longer it gets. While moving over the playing field
it must not collide with itself or with the rocks that can be found on the
playing field. If it does collide with an obstacle the game ends.

In principle the playing field has no boundaries, i.e. if the caterpillar moves
out of the playing field on one side it reappears on the oppsite side of the
playing field. This is of course only possible if no rock is in the way.


How to play
===========

The game has five different screens, each of which can be entered directly from
the title screen by pressing any of the keys 0-4. The screens differ in the
set of additional obstacles which are present on them.

After the game has started you can control the caterpillar via the cursor keys,
a joystick in port 0 or an SNES pad in the upper left socket of the Foenix SNES
adapter.

During game play you can pause the game either by pressing the space bar,
the fire button on the joystick or any of the two buttons on the front of the
SNES pad. Pressing any of these keys or buttons again resumes the game.

The number of apples eaten is shown in the upper left corner. The amount of
time which has passed since the game was started is displayed below the
playing field. The time is stopped when the game is over but it continues to be
measured while the game is paused.

After the game has ended you can press the space bar to play on the current
screen again or you can start playing on another screen by pressing any of the
keys 0-4. Pressing F3 at any time during game play or after the game has ended
stops the program and restarts SuperBASIC.


Tips
====

The clock in the caterpillar's world ticks about five times a second and you
only can turn once during a clock tick. While it is possible to change 
direction in clocktick n and then change into another direction in clock tick 
n+1 this does not work all the time, as one fifth of a second is not that 
much time to react. So be careful when planning a move that requires such a
tight turn.

This game modifes the font for instance to disply three little apple characters 
on top of the apple count. When the program stops the modified font is still 
in use. If you want to get rid of the modified character set you have to switch
your machine off and on again.
